    "str =\"eaningless integer keys, otherwise known as surrogate keys, are commonly used as primary keys for dimension tables in data warehouse designs. Our students frequently ask us â€“ what about fact tables? Should a unique surrogate key be assigned for every row in a fact table? Although for the logical design of a fact table, the answer is no, surprisingly we find a fact table surrogate key may be helpful at the physical level. We only recommend creating surrogate keys for fact tables when certain special circumstance described in this design tip apply. As a quick reminder, surrogate keys are meaningless (aka not-meaningful, artificial, sequence numbers, warehouse, etc.) keys, typically defined as an integer data type, and sequentially assigned by the data warehouse team to serve as the primary keys of the dimension tables. Surrogate keys provide a number of important benefits for dimensions including avoiding reliance on awkward 'smart' keys \""
